# vnstat-ruby

The original [vnstat-ruby](https://github.com/tlux/vnstat-ruby) gem doesn't work with vnstat 2.x. So I made a minor change (just 2 line of code) in this fork to address the issue.

I have no intention to maintain this repo in the long term. I had already submitted an issue to the origin vnstat-ruby project and, once the author fixs the issue I'll delete the fork.
